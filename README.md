# Property-Based Testing of Smart Contracts

This is part of the bachelor project by Jesper Schougaard Pedersen, Andreas Asferg Jacobsen & Sebastian Alexander Brunbjerg Nielsen

This repository features PBT of 4 smart contracts, along with some other experimental work we did along the way

- The Fibonacci smart contract is from [here](https://github.com/Concordium/concordium-rust-smart-contracts/tree/main/examples/fib)

- The Auction smart contract is from [here](https://github.com/Concordium/concordium-rust-smart-contracts/tree/main/examples/auction)

- The Commerce smart contract is a translation, by us, to Rust for the Solidity implementation [here](https://cs.au.dk/~nis/commerce/)

- The Open Vote Network smart contract is from [here](https://github.com/hrbengtsen/open-vote-network)
